### Virtual sculpture in space/world augmentation: _chip off the old block_

This sculpture is inspired by my experiences with creative block and the anxiety associated with the process of writing/creating that I often feel- 
which springs questions like _am I good enough?, does what I have to say make sense? does it even matter?_. 
That is why it begins with a blizzard of words- and you have to tap at the word-nado to make it go away, 
but some words still linger in the background and disappear gradually. 
~~It's also possible to draw using the wordnado, and have your drawings stay for a small while since the lifespan of the emitted particles is a few seconds.~~

This transitions into an augmented space where you can place a '?' made of blocks (because my sense of humor is terribly on the nose :p), with excerpts from
poems that I've not yet finished floating in the background. 
I specifically chose the symbol of a question mark because if you rotate it by 90 degrees along the axis passing through the straight line, it turns into '!'
and I find it very interesting how such a simple rotation can turn a symbol associated with anxiety and uncertainty to something associated with excitement.
It's also possible to explore this 'rotation' in this augmented space. 

The boxes that I've made the '?' out of are not perfect cubes, I've tried to translate my anxiety and discomfort 
to deformed 'boxes' (as if someone has thrown in punches from the inside) textured with weird faces. 


I'm still working on experimenting with the exact rotation, colours and stuff. I might reanimate it to transform the ? into an ! and back into a ? but I don't know eh.

"Chip off the old block" is a *promise* I'm making to myself- to not give up creating even when I think I can't.  

It is inspired by my experiences with creative block and the anxiety associated with the process of writing/creating. That is why it begins with a blizzard of words- you have to tap at the wordnado repeatedly to make it go away, but some words still linger in the background and disappear gradually. This transitions into an augmented space where you can place a '?' made of blocks in your field of view, with excerpts from unfinished poems of mine floating in the background.

Unfortunately, you can only play around in this experience if you have access to Facebook/Instagram.
