My work was directly inspired by _The Son of Man (Le fils de l'homme)_, a self-portrait by Magritte. 

I often find myself thinking about what Magritte supposedly said about the painting, he said- _Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see_ and  it is one of the first things I thought of on hearing the word _mask-_ but here in this self-portrait the artist had the agency to _choose_ a mask for himself i.e. he specifically chose an apple (perhaps because of the bibical symbolism?) and a bowler hat.

But do we, as participants in a capitalist economy have the agency to _choose_ a marker for our identity? I think it is obscured by _consumption,_ which is why I played around with the concept of a "fast food" mask. The first is something derivative of a bad pun- _Le fils de l'hommeR,_ inspired by the trope that Homer Simpson likes donuts. The second is just a burger, with a piece of ham/tomato (whatever you prefer) obscuring the face- inspired by the Happy Meals that are served at McDonalds.
